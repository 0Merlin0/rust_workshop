// Task 1: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10
//
// Task 2: Write a program that prints the sum of all odd numbers between 0 and 10
//
// Task 3: Write a function that takes an array of 5 unsigned 32-bit integers and returns the
//         largest of them
//
// Task 4: Define a struct with three integer values. Additionally define two functions:
//         One that takes a tuple of three integers and returns an instance of the struct
//         Another that takes an instance of the struct and returns a tuple of three integers

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
